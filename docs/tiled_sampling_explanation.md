# Tiled Sampling Approach for Large Image Generation

This document explains the tiled sampling approach implemented in `sampling_large_image.py` and `random_diffusion.py` for generating large, seamless images using a modified Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based on Stable Diffusion 2.

## Overview

The approach allows generating large images that exceed the model's training resolution by splitting the generation process into patches/tiles and intelligently combining them. The method uses mask images as conditioning signals to control the content in different regions of the generated image.

## Process Flow

### 1. Mask Preparation and Processing

- **Input**: A large mask image that serves as a conditioning signal
- **Preprocessing**: The large mask is loaded and possibly upsampled to match the desired output resolution
- **Representation**: Each mask value represents a different semantic class or region type (e.g., 0 for background, 1 for foreground, etc.)

### 2. Tile-based Generation Strategy

The large mask is decomposed into smaller overlapping patches that can be processed individually:

- **Patch Size Selection**: Patches are sized to fit within the model's native resolution (typically 512Ã—512 pixels)
- **Patch Extraction**: Overlapping patches are extracted from the full mask to ensure continuity
- **Latent Space Conversion**: Due to the VAE architecture of Stable Diffusion, patches are processed in the latent space at a reduced resolution (typically 1/8 of the pixel space)

### 3. Latent Code Generation Process

The diffusion model generates latent codes for the entire image patch by patch:

#### a. Initialization
- A random noise tensor is initialized for the entire latent representation of the image
- A time tracking tensor is created to monitor the diffusion progress of each region
- Empty stacks are prepared to store intermediate results

#### b. Progressive Patch Generation
For each tile/patch in the image:
1. Select the next patch location based on the lowest timestep values
2. Extract the corresponding sub-mask for this patch
3. Sample the patch using the diffusion model with the sub-mask as a conditioning signal
4. Update the global latent representation with the newly generated patch
5. Update the timestep tracking tensor for the processed region
6. Repeat until all regions reach the final diffusion timestep

This approach ensures that:
- Each patch's diffusion state is tracked separately
- Adjacent patches influence each other for coherence
- The conditioning signal guides the content type in each region

### 4. Tile-based Decoding Strategy

Once the complete latent representation is generated, it's decoded back to pixel space using a tile-based approach:

#### a. Multiple Shifted Decoding
The code employs three different shifted decodings of the latent representation:
1. **Full Image Decoding**: The entire latent code is decoded in tiles
2. **Vertical Shifted Decoding**: The latent code is shifted vertically and decoded
3. **Horizontal Shifted Decoding**: The latent code is shifted horizontally and decoded
4. **Cross (Center) Shifted Decoding**: Both horizontal and vertical shifts are applied before decoding

#### b. Hann Window Blending
The multiple decoded images are combined using Hann windows (a type of cosine window function):
1. Hann windows are created to weight the contribution of each decoded version
2. Vertical windows blend the vertical-shifted version
3. Horizontal windows blend the horizontal-shifted version
4. Center windows blend the cross-shifted version
5. The weighted sum creates a seamless final image

### 5. Final Output Assembly

- The seamlessly blended image is post-processed (normalized, etc.)
- The final image is saved along with its corresponding mask for reference
- This process can be repeated for batch generation of multiple large images

## Technical Implementation Details

### Timestep Tracking

The diffusion process uses a timestep tracking tensor that:
- Initializes all regions to timestep 0
- Increments timesteps for regions as they're processed
- Prioritizes regions with the lowest timesteps for the next generation step
- Terminates when all regions reach the final timestep

### Hann Window Implementation

The `hann_window` function creates various window patterns:
- Generates 1D cosine windows and extends them to 2D
- Creates specialized corner, edge, and center windows
- Provides different window types for different overlap scenarios
- Applies these windows during the blending of multiple decoded versions

### Conditional Scaling

The model uses classifier-free guidance with a scaling parameter:
- Higher values of `cond_scale` increase the influence of the conditioning signal
- This controls how strictly the output adheres to the mask regions
- When `cond_scale=0.0`, generation becomes unconditional

## Advantages of the Approach

1. **Seamless Integration**: Eliminates visible seams between patches
2. **Arbitrary Size Support**: Can generate images of any size, not limited by model resolution
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Processes only small patches at a time, reducing memory requirements
4. **Consistent Style**: Maintains stylistic consistency across the entire image
5. **Controlled Generation**: Uses masks to control the semantic content of different regions

## Limitations

1. **Computation Time**: Significantly slower than single-pass generation due to patch-by-patch processing
2. **Complex Implementation**: Requires careful management of patches and their diffusion states
3. **Potential Artifacts**: May still introduce subtle artifacts at tile boundaries under certain conditions

## Usage Examples

```python
# Example usage
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python sampling_large_image.py --cond_scale=3.0 --n_images=4 --image_size=2048
```

Parameters:
- `n_images`: Number of images to generate
- `batch_size`: Batch size for generation
- `label`: Class label for the mask
- `image_size`: Size of the output image
- `cond_scale`: Conditioning scale (higher = more adherence to mask)
- `sampling_steps`: Number of diffusion steps per patch
- `imgs_path`: Output directory for generated images


## Implementation Overview

The approach solves a key limitation of diffusion models: generating high-resolution images that exceed the model's native training resolution. It does this by:

1. Processing large images in smaller, manageable tiles
2. Using sophisticated blending techniques to avoid visible seams
3. Employing conditional guidance through mask images

## Key Code Components

### Model Architecture

The implementation uses two separate models:

```python
# From sampling_large_image.py
'''Images Model'''
unet = Unet(
    dim=dim,
    num_classes=num_classes,
    dim_mults=dim_mults,
    channels=channels,
    resnet_block_groups=resnet_block_groups,
    block_per_layer=block_per_layer,
)
```

1. **Image Generation Model**: Generates the actual image content conditioned on masks

## Detailed Process Flow

### 1. Mask Preparation and Processing

The process begins with either loading or generating a mask:

```python
# From sampling_large_image.py
masks=torch.cat([torch.ones((1,1,image_size//4,image_size//4))*label for label in labels], 0)
```

The masks are processed to ensure they're in the correct format:
- Resized to match the target resolution
- Each value represents a different semantic region

### 2. Tile-based Generation: The Core Algorithm

#### 2.1 Initialization of Tracking Tensors

The `RandomDiffusion` class initializes several key tracking structures:

```python
# From random_diffusion.py
img_stack=torch.randn(b, 2, 4, image_size//8, image_size//8).to(self.device)
times=torch.zeros((1,1,image_size//8,image_size//8)).int().to(self.device)
img0=torch.randn(b,4,image_size//8,image_size//8).to(self.device)
```

- `img_stack`: Stores intermediary states of patches at different timesteps
- `times`: Tracks which diffusion timestep each pixel is currently at
- `img0`: The accumulated latent representation being built incrementally

#### 2.2 Patch Selection Strategy

The algorithm strategically selects patches based on their current diffusion timestep:

```python
# From random_diffusion.py
random_indices=self.get_value_coordinates(times[0,0])[0]
i,j=torch.clamp(random_indices,p,s-p).tolist()
```

This ensures that:
1. Regions at earlier diffusion steps are prioritized
2. The generation progresses uniformly across the image
3. Adjacent patches influence each other for coherence

#### 2.3 Patch-by-Patch Diffusion Process

For each selected patch:

```python
# From random_diffusion.py
sub_img=self.random_crop(img0, i, j)
sub_img_stack=self.random_crop(img_stack, i, j)
sub_time=self.random_crop(times, i, j)
sub_mask=self.random_crop(masks, i, j, latent=False)

if sub_time.float().mean()!=(self.sampling_steps-1):
    sub_img=self.sample_one(sub_img, sub_img_stack, sub_mask, sub_time)
    
    mask_changed=torch.where(sub_time==sub_time.min(), 1 ,0).to(self.device)
    
    img0[...,i-p:i+p,j-p:j+p]=sub_img
    img_stack[:,1,:,i-p:i+p,j-p:j+p]=sub_img*mask_changed+sub_img_stack[:,1]*(mask_changed==0)
    times[...,i-p:i+p,j-p:j+p]=torch.where(sub_time==sub_time.min(), sub_time+1, sub_time)
```

This code:
1. Extracts the sub-regions for processing
2. Applies the diffusion model to advance the current patch by one timestep
3. Updates the global latent representation with the new patch
4. Increments the timestep tracking tensor for this region
5. Ensures proper gradient flow between adjacent tiles

### 3. Sophisticated Decoding with Hann Windows

The most critical part of achieving seamless results is the decoding process using Hann window overlapping:

#### 3.1 Multi-directional Decoding

The code decodes the latent representation in three different shifted positions:

```python
# From random_diffusion.py
# Full image decoding
img = self.decoding_tiled_image(z_scaled, (1, 3, h * 8, w * 8))
# Vertical slice decoding
img_v = self.decoding_tiled_image(z_scaled[..., p16:-p16], (1, 3, h * 8, w * 8 - p))
# Horizontal slice decoding
img_h = self.decoding_tiled_image(z_scaled[..., p16:-p16, :], (1, 3, h * 8 - p, w * 8))
# Cross slice decoding
img_cross = self.decoding_tiled_image(z_scaled[..., p16:-p16, p16:-p16], 
                                  (1, 3, h * 8 - p, w * 8 - p))
```

This creates four different decoded versions:
1. Full image
2. Image with vertical shifts
3. Image with horizontal shifts
4. Image with both vertical and horizontal shifts (cross)

#### 3.2 Hann Window Implementation

The Hann windows are carefully designed window functions that provide smooth transitions between patches:

```python
# From random_diffusion.py
def hann_window(size=512):
    i = torch.arange(size, dtype=torch.float)
    w = 0.5*(1 - torch.cos(2*torch.pi*i/(size-1)))
    window_center=w[:,None]*w
    window_up=torch.where(torch.arange(size)[:,None] < size//2, w, w[:,None]*w)
    # ...more window definitions...
```

The implementation creates multiple specialized window types:
- Edge windows for image boundaries
- Corner windows for image corners
- Center windows for internal regions
- Horizontal and vertical transition windows

#### 3.3 Blending Process

The final blending combines all decoded versions using the Hann windows:

```python
# From random_diffusion.py
# Applying windows
b, c, h, w = img.shape
repeat_v = windows['vertical'].repeat(b, c, h // p, w // p - 1).to(self.device)
repeat_h = windows['horizontal'].repeat(b, c, h // p - 1, w // p).to(self.device)
repeat_c = windows['center'].repeat(b, c, h // p - 1, w // p - 1).to(self.device)

img[..., p//2:-p//2] = img[..., p//2:-p//2] * (1 - repeat_v) + img_v * repeat_v
img[..., p//2:-p//2, :] = img[..., p//2:-p//2, :] * (1 - repeat_h) + img_h * repeat_h
img[..., p//2:-p//2, p//2:-p//2] = img[..., p//2:-p//2, p//2:-p//2] * (1 - repeat_c) + img_cross * repeat_c
```

This carefully weighted blend ensures:
- No visible tile boundaries
- Smooth transitions between adjacent regions
- Consistent details across the entire image

## Technical Implementation Details

The code employs several techniques to manage memory efficiently:

1. **Tiled Processing**: Only loads small patches into memory at once
   ```python
   # From random_diffusion.py
   def random_crop(self, image, i, j, latent=True):
       if latent:
           p=self.patch_size // 16
           return image[...,i-p:i+p, j-p:j+p]
       else:
           p=self.patch_size // 2
           return image[...,i*8-p:i*8+p, j*8-p:j*8+p]
   ```

2. **Progressive Generation**: Only moves forward one diffusion step at a time
   ```python
   # From random_diffusion.py
   times[...,i-p:i+p,j-p:j+p]=torch.where(sub_time==sub_time.min(), sub_time+1, sub_time)
   ```

3. **Strategic Tile Selection**: Prioritizes regions at the earliest timesteps
   ```python
   # From random_diffusion.py
   def get_value_coordinates(self,tensor):
       value_indices = torch.nonzero(tensor == tensor.min(), as_tuple=False)
       random_indices = value_indices[torch.randperm(value_indices.size(0))]
       return random_indices
   ```

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Computational Intensity**: The process is computationally expensive due to:
   ```python
   # From sampling_large_image.py in main()
   for _ in range(n_images//batch_size):
       # ... generation code ...
   ```
   Each image can take minutes to generate depending on resolution.

2. **Memory Requirements**: While efficient, large images still require substantial VRAM:
   ```python
   # From sampling_large_image.py
   def main(
           n_images=512,
           batch_size=4,
           label=1,
           image_size=2048,  # Note the large default image size
           cond_scale=3.0,
           sampling_steps=250,
           imgs_path='./results/large'):
   ```

3. **Potential Artifacts**: Even with sophisticated blending, certain content types may still show subtle inconsistencies between tiles.

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate 4 images at 2048x2048 resolution with conditioning scale 3.0
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python sampling_large_image.py --cond_scale=3.0 --n_images=4 --image_size=2048
```

### Advanced Parameters

- `n_images`: Total number of images to generate
- `batch_size`: Number of images to generate in parallel
- `label`: Which class label to use from the model
- `image_size`: Target resolution (can be arbitrary size)
- `cond_scale`: How strongly to condition on the mask (higher = more faithful to mask boundaries)
- `sampling_steps`: Number of denoising steps (higher = better quality but slower)
- `imgs_path`: Output directory

### Memory vs. Quality Tradeoffs

- For higher quality: Increase `sampling_steps` to 250-500
- For faster generation: Reduce `sampling_steps` to 50-100
- For memory constraints: Decrease `image_size` or increase `patch_size`
